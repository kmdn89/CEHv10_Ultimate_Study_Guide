# Hacking Web Applications

### <u>Web App Concepts</u>

 - Provide an interface between the end users and webservers
 - Used to support critical business functions

#### Web Application Architecture
 - Clients
 - Web Server
 - Business layer
 - Database layer

#### Web 2.0 Applications
 - Web applications that provide and infrastructure

#### Vulnerability Stack
![Vulnerability Stack](/images/webapp-vuln_stack.png)

### <u>Web App Threats</u>
![Web App Threats](/images/webapp-threats.png)

#### Injection Flaws
 - Allow untrusted data to be interpreted and executed as part of a command or query
 - Done be constructing malicious commands or queries
 - Prevalent in legacy code
 - **Types of Injection Flaw attacks**
   - SQL Injection
   - Command Injection
   - LDAP Injection
#### SQL Injection 
 - Series of malicious SQL queries that manipulate the database
 - Allows you to bypass normal security measures and obtain access to the valuable data
 - Can often be executed from the address bar
 - **Example of an SQL injection**
   - Testâ€™) ;DROP TABLE Messages;--

#### Command Injection 
 - **Shell injection**
   - Crafts an input string to gain shell access to a web server
   - Functions include system(),StartProcess(), java.lang.runtime.exec(), system.diagnostics.process.start(), and similar APIs

 - **HTML Embedding**
   - Used to deface websites virtually
   - Allows attacker to add extra HTML based content to the vulnerable web application
 - **File Injection**
   - Allows injection of malicious code into system files

![Web App File Injection](/images/webapp-fileinjection.png)

#### LDAP Injection
 - Exploit users parameters
 - Allows you to pass LDAP filters used to search the Directory services to obtain direct access to databases behind the LDAP tree
 - To test send an LDAP query to a server that generates an invalid input if the LDAP server returns an error it can be exploited

#### Broken Authentication
 - Uses vulnerbilites in the authentication or session manager functions 
 - **Session ID in URLS**
   - Attacker sniffs the network traffic and is able to acquire a session ID
 - **Password Exploitation**
   - Gains access to the web applications password database
 - **Timeout Exploitation**
   - It the timeouts are not set right and a user does not log out on a public computer the computer and be used to re open that session later
#### Sensitive Data Exposure
 - Many web applications do not protect their sensitive data properly
 - Application uses poorly written encryption code 
 - Allows an attacker to steal or modify weakly protected sensitive data

![Sensitive Data Exposure](/images/webapp-sensitivedata.png)

#### XML External Entity (XXE)
 - Server-side request forgery (**SSRF**) attack where an **application is able to parse XML input from an unreliable source** because of the **misconfigured XML parser**
 - Attacker send malicious XML input containing reference to an external entity to the victim web application
 - Allows attackers to access protected files and services

![Sensitive Data Exposure](/images/webapp-xxe.png)

#### Broken Access Control
 - Access control is broken and allows an attacker to act as users or administrators
#### Security Misconfiguration
 - Can occur on any level of an application stack
 - **Unvalidated Inputs**
   - Input from a client is not validated
 - **Parameter/Form Tampering**
   - Manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server in order to modify data
 - **Improper Error Handling**
   - Gives insight into source code 
 - **Insufficient Transport Layer Protection**
   - Supports weak algorithms and uses expired or invalid certificates
#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
 - Exploits vulnerabilities in dynamically generated web pages
 - Allows attackers to inject client side scripts into web pages viewed by other users
 - Occurs when invalidated input data is included in dynamic content 
 - Can inject malicious scripts or web content by hiding it within legitimate requests

![Web App XSS](/images/webapp-xss.png)

#### Insecure Deserialization
 - Process of liberalizing and demineralizing data objects
 - Attackers inject malicious code into serialized data
 - Insecure deserialization the malicious serialized content along with the injected malicious code
#### Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
 - Uses libraries and frameworks that have known vulnerabilities
#### Other Web Application Threats
![Other Threats](/images/webapp-otherthreats.png)

#### Directory Traversal
 - Allows an attacker to access restricted directories
 - Can manipulate variables using ../ variations
#### Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
 - Allow attackers to install malware or trick victims 
#### Watering Hole Attack
 - Identifies the site frequently surfed by victims
 - Finds vulnerabilities in this site and exploits these vulnerabilities 
#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
 - Exploits web page vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to force an unsuspected users browser to send malicious requests the did not intend
 - Done by victim holding an active session visiting a malicious site which injects an HTTPP request which compromised the trusted sites integrity
#### Cookie/Session Poisoning
 - Modification of the contents of a cookie in order to bypass security mechanisms
 - Proxy can be used to specify new user ID or other session identifiers

#### Web Services Architecture
![Web Services Architecture](/images/webapp-arch.png)

 - **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**
   - An XML based protocol 
   - allows application running on a platform to communicate with applications running on a different platform
   
 - **UDDI** ( Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) 
   - directory service 
   - **lists** all **available services**
   
 - **WSDL** (Web Services Description Language )
   - XML based language 
   - describes & **traces web services**
   
 - **WS-Security**
   - WS-Security plays an important role in securing the web services. 
   - extension to SOAP 
   - aims at maintaining the **integrity** and **confidentiality** of **SOAP messages** and **authenticating user**

#### Web Service Attack
 - Web Services are based on XML protocols such as :
     - WSDL : for  describing  **connection points**; 
     - UDDI : for  description and discovery of **web services**; 
     - SOAP : for  communication **between web services** 
   
  which are vulnerable to various web application threats.

![Web Service Attack](/images/webapp-serviceattack.png)
#### Web Services Footprinting 
 - Footprint a web application to get UDDI information
#### Web Services XML Poisoning
 - Insert malicious XML codes in SOAP
 - XML schema poisoning to generate errors in XML parsing logic
 - Allows attackers to cause denial of service attacks
#### Hidden Field Manipulation 

### <u>Hacking Methodology</u>

#### Footprint Web Infrastructure
 - First step in web application hacking
 - Helps attackers select victims
 - **Server Discovery**
   - Finds servers
 - **Service Discovery**
   - Find ports
   - Use nmap
 - **Server Identification**
   - Banner grabbing
 - **Detecting Web App Firewalls and proxies**
   - Use tool WAF00F
   - Add certain headers in the response header field
   - Use TRACE to find changes the proxy server made to the request
 - **Hidden Content**
   - Web Spidering 
   - Attacker Directed Spidering 
   - Brute Forcing
#### Web Spidering Using Burp Suite
 - Make burp suite proxy
 - Spider visits every single link on site
#### Mozenda Web Agent
 - Web Crawler
#### Attack Web Servers
 - Scan for known vulnerabilities 
 - Launch web server attacks on exploits found
 - Launch DoS attacks
#### Analyze Web Application
 - **Entry points**
   - Review HTTP request
   - Determine all user input fields
   - Determine encoding techniques
 - **Server Side Tech**
   - HTTP Fingerprinting
   - Examine Error messages
   - Examine session tokens
 - **Server Side Functionality**
   - Applications revealed to the client
   - Examine URLS
 - **Map Attack Surface**
   - Identify Various attack surfaces

![Web Attack Surface](/images/webapp-attacksurf.png)

#### Bypass Client-Side Controls
 - Client side controls restrict user inputs in transmitting data via client components and implementing measures
#### Attack Authentication Mechanism
 - Exploit design and implementation flaws in web applications
#### Username Enumeration
 - Uses trail and error method to guess username based off services response to incorrect tries
